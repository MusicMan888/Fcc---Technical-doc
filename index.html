          <p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: This document is for educational purposes only. It is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of this subject, but rather an introduction to many of the considerations that are involved in modern medical equipment management - C. Daykin 2024</p>
          <p>Medical Equipment Management varies based on many factors, these include, but are not limited to: The size, type, location, the internal management structure, the history, culture and politics of the facility. For example, a small hospital may have less equipment making downtime and equipment usage important. A smaller facility will necessarily have fewer support staff to manage the equipment. Larger facilities may have more equipment and more technicians, but will likely provide more comprehensive services which may require more expensive highly technical systems and more specialized technicians to support it. A large facility equipment downtime may be balanced by having additional back up devices. A larger facility might require extended technical services coverage, perhaps 24/7 coverage. The size of a hospital is often related to the services that it is licensed to provide. A small facility could be a community hospital providing a wide range of basic services, or a stand alone surgical center, or urgent care clinic. A large facility may be a health system having multiple emergency room areas, multiple groups of surgical suites, Cath. and EP labs, radiology and nuclear medicine, various laboratories, blood bank services, pharmacies, etc., also in many states there is a distinction regarding non-profit and for profit facilities and medicare/medicade reimbursement status.</p>
          <p> Many facilities start small and expand over time, often outgrowing their property and expanding by buying up local clinics, or groups of clinics, surgical centers, etc. The type, size and location of the facility will dictate what local and state regulation that must be followed, especially in regard to "for profit" and "not for profit" facilities and reimbursements. Equipment management will also depend on the facilities history and the internal structure of who does what. Very small facilities may have had main facilities or engineering department that was tasked with small repairs and equipment management simply because 40 years ago, medical equipment management was a new field. As the medical equipment management and the Biomedical engineering technology field grew, practices evolved. But there are often territorial disputes between, Facilities, Biomed., and IT over who repairs what. This discussion will not involve politics nor will it cover every case described above. Instead it will focus on a general equipment management process found to be successful in managing equipment in a relatively controlled situation, then expanded and updated for a hospital that doubled in size over 30 years.</p>

        <header>The Equipment Lifecycle</header>
        <artical>
          <p>A medical device is born from a need or idea to assist medical practitioner in treating or diagnosing a patients’ condition. For example: a “vital signs machine’” might include an NIBP (non-invasive blood pressure) measurement function, a SPO2 (Saturation of Peripheral Oxygen) measurement , and possibly a temperature measurement. The device itself is manufactured to meet standards of the country in which it is sold, (in this case the USA) and must meet FDA Standards to be sold on the American market. In addition, the FDAs’ Safe Medical Device Act (SMDA) requires medical device manufacturers to monitor their products and report any negative outcomes to the agency. The manufacturer is required to assign a UDI (Unique Device Identifier) and tracking in a device record which may also contain any traceable critical components, circuit board revision levels, firmware and software revisions that have been tested for compatibility (known as validation).  When a device is sold to a facility, the facility enters into an agreement with the manufacturer, where the facility and the manufacturer are required to report any negative patient outcomes to the FDA. The FDA has the authority to issue tracking orders. These orders require manufacturers to implement programs to track devices down to the patient level. Once a certain level of a specific device failure is reached, the FDA dictates what if any action must be taken to resolve the issue, up to and including removal from the market if necessary.  The equipment design and manufacturing cycle is continuous and it may take a Manufacturer years to design, build, test and cross all the regulatory hurdles in order to get a device to market.  Most equipment typically has a 10 year life, from birth to end of service support. Meaning the Manufacturer decides what the lifetime of the device should be and is required to provide support for that period. In most cases this is between 7 - 10 years, however some well built or fixed in place device might last longer. There are some devices that have not changed in basic design for 30 years and are still being sold and supported. </p>

        <artical>
          <p>Hospitals have always required maintenance departments such as a “Main Engineering Dept.” or “Facilities Dept.” who, once the building is functional are tasked with the maintenance and up keep of the building and the grounds, including the electrical, plumbing, medical gasses, heating and cooling, and all the other main hospital infrastructure components. Hospital Engineering departments existed long before medical devices were introduced, and once they were introduced, it fell on the department to develop policies for managing this equipment, as “Clinical Engineering” or “Biomedical Engineering" Departments grew, they adopted the policies. Also when agencies inspect the Hospital, both Engineering and Biomedical Engineering are often both checked for compliance. </p>
          <p>Medical Equipment management grew from the need that arose. The 1950’s brought the television which necessitated the creation of hospital electronics shops, the introduction of medical devices required a more specialized technician, who in addition to Electronics, must also repair mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic and vacuum systems, and the in 70’s the personal computer revolution resulted in the need for the hospital IT department. Over time these functions became more specialized and diverged into individual departments and functions, this evolution continues today.  Most if not all facilities are bound by federal, state and local regulation. Such as, building codes, NFPA and OSHA standards, Medical equipment management is governed by The Joint Commission, NFPA, the ANSI standard for medical lasers, American Association of Blood Banks and state agencies such as ACHA (Agency for Health Care Administration”) for the state of Florida. </p>
          <p>Hospital Policies and are often written to directly address the regulatory standards, standards that have evolved over time, often using the exact same language, for example: the hospital must create a unique inventory of patient care equipment “regardless of ownership”  or how at one point in the past the requirement was to incorporate all medical equipment into the management program, however as inventories grew and departments had accumulated significant data regarding device safety. The standards were adjusted to allow hospitals to evaluate equipment based upon risk posed to the patients, and service histories permitting certain types of low risk equipment to be added to an alternative maintenance program or removed from the maintenance program altogether.</p>
          <p>Tools that have evolved to assist in medical equipment management include: Computerized Maintenance Management Software (CMMS), Automated test devices, such as electrical safety analyzers, defibrillator analyzers, electrosurgical analyzers. Other tools might include, additional databases, word processing, spreadsheet, print to pdf and email applications, Document scanners and shared storage, with the incorporation of wireless networking throughout modern healthcare facilities, RF locator devices are often employed to track highly mobile device. The main management tool is the Computerized Maintenance Management Software which enables the facility to add new equipment, schedule preventative maintenance activities, document warranty, cost, contract status, manage and document all maintenance and service activities and to collect and report these activities and data to hospital leadership. </p>

        <header>The Management Cycle</header>
        <artical>
          <p>Equipment enters a facility many different ways, through “minor or “capitol” equipment” purchases. Manufacturer sales representatives are often contacted to demo new equipment. Equipment can be consigned (provided for free as long as a specified level of disposables are purchased.) Equipment is rented in the event of special circumstances or high census periods. Loaner devices are often requested to replace equipment that requires factory service. Physicians bring in their personally owned medical equipment to use. Patient’s and family members bring in personally owned equipment. Equipment is rented at the request of physicians (for the treatment of patients that might start in the facility and continue at home. Staff bring in appliances for personal use. </p>
          <p>When equipment enters the hospital regulatory bodies (The Joint Commission) generally specifies that you can either “All patient care related electrical appliances will be included in the equipment management program, regardless of ownership.”, or the facility may establish an Alternative Equipment Maintenance (AEM) program where during the incoming evaluation process the facility evaluates each device based on physical risk associated with use and equipment failure history to determine inclusion in the inventory, this would naturally include all high risk and life support equipment. In either case the hospital must specify in writing which method they use and all activities and associated frequencies for maintaining, inspecting and testing all medical equipment in the inventory. These activities and associated frequencies should be in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations or with strategies of an AEM program. The alternatative equipment maintenance (AEM) strategy program must not reduce safety and is based on accepted standards of practice.</p>
          <p>I find it best to think of the equipment management lifecycle as a closed loop system. The main tool for managing this system is the CMMS (the Equipment Management Database) and in my opinion there should strict adherence to clearly defined  processes for adding new equipment, scheduling maintenance, and removing records from the database. Like any database “garbage in, gives garbage out”, therefore limiting the number of people making these changes is essential. Equipment enters the loop through the incoming inspection, once the device is added to the database, tested, labeled, it is placed into patient use. Depending upon the maintenance requirements the device is added to the maintenance program, which may consist of a visual inspection, an electrical safety test, and/or a performance verification test depending on the device function, risk, and manufacturer requirements. </p>
          <p>Equipment will, over time, require service and modern CMM Software provides the ability for end users to generate work requests which can be converted to Work Orders for documenting repairs, at the conclusion of which the device is again validated for patient use and returned to service. Eventually equipment either becomes no longer cost effective to repair, obsolete, or is replaced by next generation equipment. At which time it is sequestered, the labels are removed, the records are deactivated in the database and the equipment is removed from the facility. </p>

      <section class='main-section' id='Incoming_Inspection'>
        <header>Incoming Inspection</header>
        <artical>
          <p>The incoming inspection should be the entry point for equipment entering the facility, it should be the only entry point. For hospital owned equipment, accompanying the device should be a user and service manual and the purchase order with the cost, and purchase order # or sales order#. The device will be evaluated for inclusion in the Equipment Management System. Regulatory bodies, such as The Joint Commission recognize that medical equipment management has become more challenging over time with the increasing volume of medical device being used in the Hospital environment. Therefore, facilities are given the option to either include all of their patient care equipment or a more limited list of equipment based upon: The Equipment Function + The Physical Risk (it poses to the patients or staff) + The Maintenance Requirements - This is summed up in the formula: <code>EM = F + PR+ MR</code> (this scoring system was developed by Larry Fennigkoh and Bridget Smith, published by The Joint Commission. In the past, for example Hospital Policy would have required all devices be included, however over time as the hospital grew, management adopted the more limited list of devices that score a 12 or above on this risk scale - recently another factor has come into play, and that is the risk posed by IT related vulnerabilities - hacking, ransomware, security of protected health information, and no doubt there will be future consideration resulting from the modern AI revolution. </p>
          <p>Once the device is EM# is established and the device is determined to be included in the management system, the device is then further classified as either:  loaner / evaluation / short term or hospital owned / long term lease / etc. Some facilities may identify this additional classification by using a unique series of control# (for example: if a long term device is assigned a 6 digit # starting with a letter, a short term device may be assigned a 5 digit control# starting with a number.) or a colorful sticker might be used to visually ID short term devices, or an electronic asset tag could be assigned. The point being, these device will at some point need to be removed from the facility and these steps will help in locating them. In any case, the device is assigned a Control# and the electronic equipment record is created, the device is added to the pm schedule, an incoming inspection WO is also created, NFPA 99 chapter on Electrical Equipment specifies hospital requirements:
            <p> <code>all patient care equipment entering the patient care vicinity the ground wire resistance must be < 0.50 ohms</code> and <code> shall be tested (in accordance with specific sections on measuring leakage "touch current") before being put into service the first time and after any repair or modification that might have compromised electrical safety</code><code>the leakage current shall not exceed 100uA for ground wire closed and 500uA ac for ground wire open</code></p>
            <p> Any associated documentation would be scanned into a shared drive folder and linked to the equipment record and and depending on the facility - a PM label is typically affixed to the device indicating the device is safe for use and when it will be due for it’s next inspection. The equipment manuals should be added to the maintenance library. </p>
          <p>Loaner / Evaluation / Short Term Rental devices - These devices will not have the same level of information as Hospital Owned or Long Term Rentals or Consignment devices which will typically have a contract or PO#, one method of managing short term devices might be to utilize a secondary database to manage these devices. Most facilities will probably want to use the main CMMS and will find a way to differentiate these devices from the main inventory. Other devices that require special handling might be large fixed devices such as radiology, CT, MRI, and other large fixed systems. These devices are often part of a larger imaging contract, where it might be easier or smarter to use the contract vendors “site #” as the device control# - this makes managing the vendor’s service documentation much easier to manage. </p>

      <section class='main-section' id='Preventive_Maintenance'>
        <header>Preventive Maintenance</header>
        <artical>
          <p>Preventive Maintenance or “Scheduled Maintenance” are periodically scheduled maintenance activities, that are scheduled using the CMMS based on hospital policy. For example: if a hospital utilizes the physical risk scoring system, if a device’s score is 12 or greater the device is to be included in the PM program. Preventive Maintenance frequency might be based on the “Maintenance Requirement Criteria” However, unless the manufacturer specifies otherwise, the PM frequency is generally never greater than 12 months, and certain devices may require more frequent maintenance, if for example, it is impossible to get the end user to properly perform their periodic maintenance activities, it may be necessary to service a device quarterly to ensure the patients receive safe, properly functioning equipment. </p>
          <p class='mrList'>Maintenance Requirement  -  PM Frequency</p>
          <code>
              <ol class='m_list'>
                <li class='m_lst_itm'>  Minimal - Annual</li>
                <li class='m_lst_itm'>  Below Average - Annual</li>
                <li class='m_lst_itm'>  Average - Annual</li>
                <li class='m_lst_itm'>  Above Average - Semi-Annual</li>
                <li class='m_lst_itm'>  Extensive - Semi-Annual</li>
              </ol>
            </code>
          <p>Preventive Maintenance generally involves three main components: A Visual Inspection, an Electrical Safety test, and Quality Assurance or Performance Testing. True preventive maintenance would also include monitoring and replacing high wear (or high failure rate) items, before they fail, thus achieving maximum up time. This approach however may be considered too expensive (especially for smaller facilities) and should be considered only if a certain device is often failing in a consistent and predictable way or critical devices that should never fail. </p>
          <p>Managing the PM schedule (and in turn The Database) are the most challenging aspects of the equipment management process , so important in fact, that it can make or break the Clinical Engineering department. A well controlled and effectively managed database will result in increased uptime, higher PM completion rates, department efficiency, and compliance with hospital policies, regulations and increased employee satisfaction. On the other hand, a poorly designed PM program and a poorly maintained database, will result in frustration, inefficiency, poor quality equipment, the potential for patient or user harm, and the the likelihood of non-compliance with local, state and federal regulations. </p>
          <p>Modern CMMS provide the user with flexible ways to schedule PM depending on the situation, for example in a facility with a surgical suite there may be too much equipment to schedule by department, instead, It might make more sense to schedule equipment by device type so the work load may be balanced over the year, additionally “critical care type areas” might have special dress codes and rules that discourage frequently entering and leaving the department. Generally you select a start date and, and a frequency, you develop a checklist, a safety test or a QA form - in some systems the test criteria can be sent to a device that gets loaded with the monthly PM work orders, checklists and safety tests, and you take this device to the department and use it to test your equipment. At the end of each day you upload the completed tests to the CMMS which automatically updates and closes the PM work orders. Other facilities may have different methods but the process is the same, Before the beginning of the month the PM lists are generated, they are then distributed to the various technicians, who attempt to locate each device on their respective lists, inspect and test the equipment and the update the CMMS with the results of the maintenance activities. </p>
          <p>The PM process is the main method for correcting the database, however as previously stated it’s critical to have a formalized method to add, edit and remove equipment records. Along with having as few people as possible editing the database. It’s important everyone understands the schedule and scheduling process, however limiting the number of people making changes reduces the chances of introducing errors. </p>

      <section class='main-section' id='The_Repair_Process'>
        <header>The Repair Process</header>
        <artical>
          <p>Most modern CMMS systems provide the capability for the end user to request service, and for the technical staff to convert these requests into repair work orders, that the technician may use to document the repair, including any parts used. This is commonly known as “unscheduled maintenance.”  Typically the facility will establish a policy regarding general work order procedures in order to define what the end user must do to obtain service (example: tagging the device “do not use” and filling out an electronic work request), and a general outline of the repair process and desired documentation process that repair technicians should follow to obtain safe, consistent, reportable results when repairing equipment. These activities include searching for service documentation, contacting technical support, identifying and ordering parts, obtaining necessary disposables needed to test the device, cleaning, ordering and replacing parts, updating firmware or software, verifying proper operation, calibrating the device, etc. Of course, this may also involve obtaining a loaner, if the device is critical. Contacting vendors in the case of consignment or short term rental devices for replacement or exchange devices. Once repaired, cleaned, calibrated and functionally tested, if the devices’ case was opened, it’s best practice to verify electrical safety. The device can then be returned for patient use. The repair should be documented in the CMMS including any parts used, the work order should also contain the date / time of the service request, the requesters name and contact info, a description of the problem, the location of the device, the technicians name, the analysis or what the technician found, was the complaint verified, if so what was done to resolve it, if not why not? And the date / time the problem was resolved.</p>

      <section class='main-section' id='Equipment_Retirement'>
        <header>Equipment Retirement</header>
        <artical>
          <p>Eventually all equipment reaches a point where it becomes no longer sensible or economical to repair it, for example when the repair cost exceeds or approaches the replacement cost. Eventually, equipment is superseded by newer models and manufacturers “sunset” or end support on a product. The typical lifespan of a device is 7 - 10 years. When a device is no longer readily repairable, the technician will contact the manufacturer and attempt to obtain a “End Of Life” letter, if none is available, I recommend preparing whatever justification is required, the labeling should be removed from the device, the device should be cleaned and decontaminated, then put in a secure location for eventual sale or disposal. The key idea here is to ensure, defective equipment is tightly controlled until it leaves the facility to ensure patients are never exposed to defective equipment. Also with the advent of the EMR (Electronic Medical Record) - protected health information and electronic storage devices (hard drives) must be removed from devices and securely disposed of.
